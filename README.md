# UncertainData.jl
A Julia package for dealing with data values with associated uncertainties and
datasets consisting of uncertain values.

## Goals

1. Systematic and intuitive ways of representing uncertain data.

2. Easy and robust resampling of uncertain data, given pre-defined or
custom user-defined constraints.

3. Provide a framework for robust computation of ensemble statistics for
uncertain data.
