## UncertainData.jl v0.1.2

- Support elementary mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*` and `^`) between arbitrary 
    uncertain values of different types. Also works with the combination of scalars and 
    uncertain values. Because elementary operations should work on arbitrary uncertain 
    values, a resampling approach is used to perform the mathematical operations. This 
    means that all mathematical operations return a vector containing the results of 
    repeated element-wise operations (where each element is a resampled draw from the 
    furnishing distribution(s) of the uncertain value(s)). The default number of 
    realizations is set to `10000`. This allows calling `uval1 + uval2` for two uncertain 
    values `uval1` and `uval2`. If you need to tune the number of resample draws to `n`, 
    you need to use the `+(uval1, uval2, n)` syntax (similar for the operators). In the 
    future, elementary operations might be improved for certain combinations of uncertain
    values where exact expressions for error propagation are now, for example using the 
    machinery in `Measurements.jl` for normally distributed values.
- Support for trigonometric functions added (`sin`, `sind`, `sinh`, `cos`,
    `cosd`, `cosh`, `tan`, `tand`, `tanh`, `csc`, `cscd`, `csch`, `csc`, `cscd`, `csch`, 
    `sec`, `secd`, `sech`, `cot`, `cotd`, `coth`, `sincos`, `sinc`, `sinpi`, `cosc`, 
    `cospi`). Inverses are also defined (`asin`, `asind`, `asinh`, `acos`,
    `acosd`, `acosh`, `atan`, `atand`, `atanh`, `acsc`, `acscd`, `acsch`, `acsc`, `acscd`, 
    `acsch`, `asec`, `asecd`, `asech`, `acot`, `acotd`, `acoth`).
    Beware: if the support of the funishing distribution for an uncertain value lies partly 
    outside the domain of the function, you risk encountering errors.
    These also use a resampling approach, using `10000` realizations by default. 
    Use either the `sin(uval)` syntax for the default, and `sin(uval, n::Int)` to tune the 
    number of samples.

## UncertainData.jl v0.1.1

- Indexing implemented for `UncertainIndexValueDataset`. 
- Resampling implemented for `UncertainIndexValueDataset`.
- Uncertain values and uncertain datasets now support `minimum` and `maximum`.
- `support(uv::AbstractUncertainValue)` now always returns an interval from 
    [IntervalArithmetic.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/IntervalArithmetic.jl/)
- `support_overlap` now computes overlaps also for fitted theoretical distributions.
- Added more plotting recipes. 
- All implemented uncertain data types now support resampling. 
- Improved general documentation. Added a reference to [
    Measurements.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/Measurements.jl) and an explanation 
    for the differences between the packages.
